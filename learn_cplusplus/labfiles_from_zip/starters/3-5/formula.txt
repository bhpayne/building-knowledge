Here's the formula for the monthly payment.


M = P * ( J / ( 1 - ( 1 + J) ** -N))

where

M is the monthly payment
P = Initial Loan Amount
J = I/ (12 x 100)
I = interest rate
N = Number of months over which loan is amortized


Note:  In the formula above, ** represents exponentiation - i.e.,
    raise (1 + J) to the -N power.  This is not an actual
    operator in C++, so you must use the pow() function.
