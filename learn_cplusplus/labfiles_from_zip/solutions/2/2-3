You never really know if you have listed all of the attributes or all of
the operations.  You may not need them all.  You get by with the subset
of attribues and operations needed to solve a particular problem.  For
example a  'Person'  in a Motor  Vehicle  Registration  Domain  may have
different attributes and operations than a 'Person' in  a Hospital Study
Domain.  During the implementation of a design, you might realize  that
an operation or an attribute was  missing. You can always add it later.
The process is iterative.
