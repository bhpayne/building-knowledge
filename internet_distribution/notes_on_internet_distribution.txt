objective: get internet in a rural farm-centered county in the United States

No other nearby or similar counties have solved this problem

what are the dependencies to get success?
* right of way
* cost of laying fiber
* cost of end points

current situation
* current market in town: everyone has availability. $65/month; fast reliable internet
* current rural market: slow unreliable and expensive 
--> Current rural market prevents families from seeing rural area as desirable

what does success look like?
* fast reliable affordable internet available in all homes (ignoring Amish residences)

why: availability of Internet creates an improved future market for Internet. 
Internet draws in young people who then create additional need for fast internet.

minimum success model:
* extending the current rural slow unreliable expensive availability is not acceptable
* needs to be good enough that young (<40) educated people move to the county


== Market segmentation ==
* businesses
* farms
* rural residences
* in-town residences
* schools

agriculture requires internet
--> how many and where are factory farms (kfo farms)
--> how much bandwidth does your operation need?

weekend tourism requires internet
--> how much bandwidth?

cottage tourist require internet
--> how many non-resident land owners exist?
--> how much bandwidth?

rural residents want internet
--> how many? clustered how?
--> how much bandwidth?



== technology options == 
* lay fiber
* power lines
* microwave
* mobile (smart phone)
* DSL
* satellite
* cable
* dial-up


comparison for penetration of market given availability:
Another state reported that it has a potential penetration of up to 90% of homes
--> how many use it?

benefits
* quality of life --> streaming Netflix
* makes area more attractive to young educated families --> tax base
* doctor check-ups
* remote workers (telework)
* education


support:
* rural residents want it
* service companies don't want to support distribution
* county doesn't want to support funding
* state doesn't want to support funding
* federal support (CAF II) creates monopolies. Then only large companies get money

service company makes money 
* monthly charge per household
* creation of monopoly
example companies: frontier, Charter

what are the costs of fiber?
* capital investment
** laying fiber: $30,000 per mile
** other supporting equipment
* maintenance
* repair
** repairing broken lines due to trackers with plows

contingencies and risks?

target profile attributes:
* young
* educated
The community is not specifically seeking artists, recently released from incarceration, or homeless people.

what if you have infinite money?
* technology exists
* service providers install equipment and fiber
* customers get an affordable price 

--> need capital investment
--> need education for people to not cut fiber

what's the ratio of people impacted to total investment
example: 1 person to $50,000

alternatively, how to split cost when there are isolated clusters and separated individuals

== motivation for numerical model for geographic distribution of resources ==

claim: houses are clustered (probably on a power law distribution) -- some houses are isolated

claim: if internet penetrates to only the most clustered developments, how many people does that reach and at what cost?
As the penetration is expanded to more people and lower density clusters, how does the cost grow?
What's the comparison to 100% market penetration?

claim: cost of penetration does not grow linearly 

---> how to model cost as a function of penetration?

start with randomly placed houses and randomly placed source (no clustering)
-> show that fractal distribution of links is better than direct connect

cluster houses
re-test comparison of direct connect and fractal distribution
